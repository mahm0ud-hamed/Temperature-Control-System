Temperature Control System 
The ATMEGA32 embedded project offers precise and customizable temperature control for room environments, seamlessly merging advanced technologies to enhance user comfort. Employing an LM32 temperature sensor, the system accurately detects ambient temperature, ensuring a reliable foundation for climate management. The analog temperature readings are seamlessly transformed into digital data through the Analog-to-Digital Converter (ASDC), guaranteeing precision in temperature measurement.

User interaction is facilitated through a user-friendly keypad, leveraging Digital Input/Output (DIO) capabilities. This allows users to input their preferred higher and lower temperature thresholds, which are then securely stored in the EEPROM using the efficient I2C communication protocol. The EEPROM serves as non-volatile memory, ensuring data persistence even in the absence of power.

To augment user convenience, the system incorporates Bluetooth communication via UART, enabling users to remotely monitor and control the temperature settings. Through a dedicated mobile application or any Bluetooth-enabled device, users can seamlessly communicate with the embedded system, providing real-time feedback and adjustment capabilities. This integration of technologies ensures an intelligent, user-centric temperature control system, combining accuracy, ease of use, and remote accessibility for a comprehensive and efficient solution.
